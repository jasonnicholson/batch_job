So in this pull request is documentation and cleanup of the batch_job code. 

This is my first pull request and I realize this pull request might be overwhelming. Here is an overview:

- Formatted documentation.
- A new example. More to come. The one I provided needs some work. batch_job and Simulink don't always play nice.
- I cleaned up some of your input parsing for clarity. The code is harder to track when you use a cell array and dump the elements of each cell as inputs to the function call. It is a slick trick but hard read when new to batch job.

That's it for now.
