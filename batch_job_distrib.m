%BATCH_JOB_DISTRIB Distribute a MATLAB for loop across several PCs
%
%   output = batch_job_distrib(func, input, [workers, [global_data]], ...)
%
% If you have a for loop which can be written as:
%
%   for a = 1:size(input, 2)
%       output(:,a) = func(input(:,a), global_data);
%   end
%
% where input is a numeric array and output is a numeric or cell array,
% then batch_job_distrib() can parallelize the work across multiple worker
% MATLAB instances on multiple (unlimited) networked worker PCs as follows:
%
%   output = batch_job_distrib(func, input, workers, global_data);
%
% This is a replacement for parfor in this use case, if you don't have the
% Parallel Computing Toolbox and/or Distributed Computing Server.
%
% There is also an asynchronous mode, which returns immediately, passing
% back a handle to a function which can load the output data later:
%
%   output = batch_job_distrib(..., '-async'); % Start an asynchronous computation
%   ...                                        % Do other stuff here
%   output = output();                         % Get the results here
%
% The function can always spread the work across multiple MATLABs on the
% local PC, but the requirements for it to run on OTHER PCs are that:
%  - There is an ssh executable on the system path of the local PC.
%  - All worker PCs can be ssh'd into non-interactively (i.e. without
%    manually entering a password).
%  - MATLAB is on the system path of all worker PCs.
%  - Every worker has a valid license for MATLAB and all required toolboxes
%    for the user ssh'ing in.
%  - The current directory can be written to from all worker PCs via the
%    SAME path.
%  - All the required functions are on the MATLAB paths of every worker PC.
%  - The networked filesystem supports file locks (not crucial, but safer).
%  - All the worker PCs honour the networked filesystem file locks (again,
%    not crucial, but safer).
%
% The input arguments func and global_data may optionally be function
% names. When the latter is called it outputs the true global_data. Note
% that global_data could be incorporated into func before calling
% batch_job, using an anonymous function, but the functionality provided
% here is more flexible. For example, normally every worker loads a copy of
% global_data into its own memory space, but this can be avoided if
% global_data is a function which loads the data into shared memory via a
% memory mapped file. Indeed, this is the most efficient way of doing 
% things - the data doesn't need to be saved to disk first (as it's already
% on the disk), and only one copy is loaded per PC, regardless of the
% number of workers on that PC. Passing global_data through a function call
% also allows the function to do further initializations, such as setting
% the path.
%
% Notes:
%  - The workers need not all run the same operating system, but they must
%    all have working versions of the required functions, including where
%    these are platform-dependent, e.g. mex files.
%  - If a single worker uses 100% of CPU due to the code already being
%    parallelized internally, then there is little to be gained by having
%    more than one MATLAB worker instance on each worker PC.
%  - There is little point using this function if the for loop would
%    complete in a single MATLAB instance faster than it takes to start a
%    second MATLAB instance and load the necessary data in that instance.
%
%IN:
%   func - a function handle or function name string
%   input - Mx..xN numeric input data array, to be iterated over the
%           trailing dimension.
%   workers - Wx2 cell array, with each row being {hostname, num_workers},
%             hostname being a text string indicating the name of a worker
%             PC ('' for the local PC), and num_workers being the number of
%             MATLAB worker instances to start on that PC. Default: {'',
%             feature('numCores')}.
%   global_data - a data structure, or function handle or function name
%                 string of a function which returns a data structure, to
%                 be passed to func. Default: global_data not passed to
%                 func.
%   '-async' - flag indicating to operate in asynchronous mode, returning
%              immediately, and completing the job in the background.
%   '-progress' - flag indicating to display a progress bar.
%   '-keep' - flag indicating intermediate result files should be kept.
%   '-timeout', timeInSecs - option pair indicating a maximum time to allow
%                            each iteration to run before killing it. 0
%                            means no timeout is used. If non-zero, the
%                            current MATLAB instance is not used to run any
%                            iterations. If negative, the absolute value is
%                            used, but iterations are rerun if they
%                            previously timed out; otherwise timed-out
%                            iterations are skipped. Default: 0 (no
%                            timeout).
%
%OUT:
%   output - Px..xN numeric or cell output array, or if in asynchronous
%            mode, a handle to a function which will return the output
%            array when called (blocking while the batch job finishes, if
%            necessary).
